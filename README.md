# Simple text editor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Initial setup

Run `npm install` in order to setup application

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server.

## Notes

## Must have

- We need to see your own code. It is not permitted to apply and configure a ready-to-use component for text formatting. We need to see your own solution. However you can use other handy components and libraries.
- User should be able to interact with words of text by some action like double-click or some other way, to select a word. When the word is selected, the user should have possibility to apply options for this word. For simplification we expect to select separate words only; it is not expected to support selection for a part of text.
- Minimal required formatting list is Bold, Italic and Underline.
- Formatting settings should be persisted into an in-memory model. When the user selects formatted word, the component should indicate, what formatting options are applied. So then a repetetive formatting application removes these styles (i.e. click bold-botton - get bold text, click bold-botton again - return text weight to normal). It should be possible to apply Bold, Italic and Underline to a word at the same time.
- Besides formatting options, the user should be able to see synonyms for any word. For getting synonyms use https://www.datamuse.com/api/. Synonyms loading should be implemented out of the component and provided into the component in some way.
- User should be able to replace a word with a synonym, while keeping all formatting settings.
- The solution must be flexible and extendable, so new functionality can be added in the future.
- Target completion time is 2 hours. We would rather see what you were able to do in 2 hours, than a full-blown solution youâ€™ve spent days implementing. Note that in addition to quality, time used is also factored into scoring the task.
